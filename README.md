# Offensive Software Exploitation (OSE) Course

This repository is for the Offensive Software Exploitation Course I am teaching at Champlain College and currently doing it for free online (check the YouTube channel for the recordings). Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on [HTID Course](http://opensecuritytraining.info/HTID.html), but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publically available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.

**Vulnerable Software:**
The vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/). Check each lab for the software used in that lab and from where to download it.

**Tool(s) used:**
1. Immunity Debugger: [download](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/)
2. Kali Linux: [download](https://www.kali.org/)
3. CFF Explorer: [download](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388)
4. NetCat: [download](https://joncraton.org/blog/46/netcat-for-windows/)
5. Others!

**Target(s) used:**
Download a Windows 10 VM from Microsoft VMs (currently using Version 1809 Build 17763.1339) [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). This will be used for most of the labs, except for the EggHunter lab, I used a Windows 7 VM, also from Microsoft VMs (currently offline so check archive.org).
