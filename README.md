Offensive Software Exploitation Course

This repository is for the Offensive Software Exploitation Course I am teaching at Champlain College.

Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on Opensecuritytraining.info, but the labs were fully created by me. I used publically available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.

Vulnerable Software:
The vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at exploit-db.com.

Tools used:
1. Immunity Debugger
2. Kali Linux

Targets used:
1. Download any Windows 10 VM from Microsoft VMs. This was used for most of the labs, except for the EggHunter lab, I used a Windows 7 VM, also from Microsoft.
