# Offensive Software Exploitation (OSE) Course

This repository is for the Offensive Software Exploitation Course I am teaching at Champlain College.

Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on http://opensecuritytraining.info, but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publically available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.

**Vulnerable Software:**
The vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at http://exploit-db.com. I will point them out later when I find time.

**Tools used:**
1. Immunity Debugger
2. Kali Linux
3. CFF Explorer
4. NetCat
5. Others!

1. Download any Windows 10 VM from Microsoft VMs. This was used for most of the labs, except for the EggHunter lab, I used a Windows 7 VM, also from Microsoft VMs.
